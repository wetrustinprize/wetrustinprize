# Premio's Shift

[/premio-shift](https://github.com/wetrustinprize/premio-shift)

It was initially called "Peter's Shift", it was a simple encryption method I made to send a riddle to my friend.

I made this tool so I can encrypt/decrypt messages more easily because doing it manually was kinda hard.

# Simple Guess-The-Word

[/simple-guesstheword](https://github.com/wetrustinprize/simple-guesstheword)

One of my first Python projects, it is a very simples program that "guesses" the word you are thinking by asking if there is a specific letter in it.

It is kinda buggy lol.

# Demon Hunter

[/demonhunter](https://github.com/wetrustinprize/demonhunter)

My attempt on making a Garry's Mod gamemode, it is based on the Murder gamemode, but with demons and screen effects.

_never finished it, has a lot of bugs, maybe I make a better version on S&Box_
